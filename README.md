# OurWorldsForum

Dear reader, you're probably wondering what this mysteriously sounding project called "OurWorlds" is. Allow me to describe it from the beginning.
OurWorlds originally started to take shape around 2014-2015. Initially, along with my friends, we decided to create an amateur text-based role-playing game ([PBF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play-by-post_role-playing_game)) that would take place through an online forum ([PBF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play-by-post_role-playing_game)). I was quite young at that time, but I was entrusted with the task of creating the forum based on the MyBB engine (which was quite advanced for those times). I had to take care of the server and website hosting, ensure the database was set up, and prepare the basic layout. From the original versions of the forum, not much remains, but we meticulously transferred our posts and role-playing threads. Many of them didn't survive to this day, but no one can take away the fun we had there. Ultimately, the forum still stands today, and as part of learning React.

The forum, unfortunately, is still not fully responsive. The number of templates to edit would require too much effort for a single project, but I can still take pride in the fact that a lot of work has been put into it, providing me with valuable knowledge. Describing all the details would be difficult, as there has been involvement in various areas. Customizing the appearance, modifying plugins â€“ all of this required time and dedication. For me, this was my first hobby-related immersion in the field of IT, so I consider it a kind of keepsake. This place stands as a testimony to the many efforts I've invested and the knowledge gained during this process.


I gained the skill of operating in a database, covering migrations, editing, and executing basic queries. I successfully integrated the forum with the Discord platform, utilizing various plugins. I thoroughly familiarized myself with the functionalities of CMS (content management systems), such as MyBB and phpBB. Additionally, I acquainted myself with the PHP language, enabling me to customize the appearance of the entire forum according to individual preferences.
